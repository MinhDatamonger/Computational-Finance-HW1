This is my first homework submission for the course Computational Finance, which involves topics of numerical integration, Black-Scholes martingale pricing, and variance simulation. The questions themselves can be found in the file "Exercise Set 1.pdf", while my theoretical answers to them can be found in the file "Computational_Finance_HW1.pdf".
